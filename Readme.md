Generalized context-free languages
==================================

I am trying to define generalized notions of context-free languages. My secret goal is to provide meaningful, grammar-independent notions of complexity for the functions mapping from trees to model-theoretic objects (as in semantics).

The current state of the project is described in *ContextFreeLanguages.pdf*
